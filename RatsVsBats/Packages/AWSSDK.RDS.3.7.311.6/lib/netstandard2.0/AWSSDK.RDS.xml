            BacktrackTo is provided for backwards compatibility only and assigning a non-Utc DateTime

            <para>
            A blue/green deployment creates a staging environment that copies the production environment.
            In a blue/green deployment, the blue environment is the current production environment.
            The green environment is the staging environment. The staging environment stays in
            sync with the current production environment using logical replication.

            <para>
            You can make changes to the databases in the green environment without affecting production
            workloads. For example, you can upgrade the major or minor DB engine version, change
            database parameters, or make schema changes in the staging environment. You can thoroughly
            test changes in the green environment. When ready, you can switch over the environments

            A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for

            After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes
            before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as
            the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action
            before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster.
            This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default
            database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined
            by the <c>character_set_database</c> parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i>
            option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS console</a>
            or the <c>DescribeDBClusterParameters</c> operation to verify that your DB cluster
            parameter group has been created or modified.

            A DB parameter group is initially created with the default parameters for the database
            engine used by the DB instance. To provide custom values for any of the parameters,
            you must modify the group after creating it using <c>ModifyDBParameterGroup</c>. Once
            you've created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance
            using <c>ModifyDBInstance</c>. When you associate a new DB parameter group with a
            running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB instance without failover for the new
            DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect.

            <para>
            After you create a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating
            your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter
            group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create action before the parameter
            group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for
            parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance,
            such as the character set for the default database defined by the <c>character_set_database</c>
            parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon
            RDS console</a> or the <i>DescribeDBParameters</i> command to verify that your DB
            parameter group has been created or modified.

            Creates an Aurora global database spread across multiple Amazon Web Services Regions.
            The global database contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability,
            and a read-only secondary cluster that receives data from the primary cluster through

            Forces a failover for a DB cluster.
            
             
            <para>
            For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas
            (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster
            writer).
            </para>
             
            <para>
            For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, after RDS terminates the primary DB instance, the internal
            monitoring system detects that the primary DB instance is unhealthy and promotes a
            readable standby (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance
            (the cluster writer). Failover times are typically less than 35 seconds.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if one
            exists, when the primary DB instance fails. A Multi-AZ DB cluster automatically fails
            over to a readable standby DB instance when the primary DB instance fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover.
            Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean
            up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when
            the failover is complete.

             <i>Failing over</i> - Use this operation to respond to an unplanned event, such as

            transaction data that wasn't replicated to the chosen secondary before the failover
            event occurred. However, the recovery process that promotes a DB instance on the chosen
            seconday DB cluster to be the primary writer DB instance guarantees that the data
            is in a transactionally consistent state.

            and from <c>inactive</c> back to <c>available</c>. To change the availability status
            of the CEV, it must not currently be in use by an RDS Custom instance, snapshot, or

            After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes
            before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as
            the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully complete the create operation
            before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially
            important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for
            a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the <c>character_set_database</c>
            parameter. You can use the <i>Parameter Groups</i> option of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon
            RDS console</a> or the <c>DescribeDBClusterParameters</c> operation to verify that
            your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.

            <para>
            If the modified DB cluster parameter group is used by an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster,
            Aurora applies the update immediately. The cluster restart might interrupt your workload.
            In that case, your application must reopen any connections and retry any transactions
            that were active when the parameter changes took effect.

            If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned
            IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take
            time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load,
            storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned
            (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times
            are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During
            the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance
            degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are
            suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including
            modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a
            read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

            When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint

            Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The main use case for
            mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use
            Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't
            accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. For more

            If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned
            IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take
            time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load,
            storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned
            (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times
            are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During
            the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance
            degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are
            suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including
            modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a
            read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

            your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter

            Backup duration is a function of the amount of changes to the database since the previous

            a read replica cannot be promoted to a standalone instance when it is in the <c>backing-up</c>

            instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB
            cluster in <c>DBClusterIdentifier</c>. You can create DB instances only after the

            available.

            If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored DB instance,
            then rename your original DB instance before you call the <c>RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot</c>
            operation. RDS doesn't allow two DB instances with the same name. After you have renamed
            your original DB instance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original
            name of the DB instance as the <c>DBInstanceIdentifier</c> in the call to the <c>RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot</c>
            operation. The result is that you replace the original DB instance with the DB instance
            created from the snapshot.

            In most cases, tags aren't copied by default. However, when you restore a DB instance
            from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you specify new tags. If yes, the new tags
            are added to the restored DB instance. If there are no new tags, RDS looks for the
            tags from the source DB instance for the DB snapshot, and then adds those tags to
            the restored DB instance.

            Aurora promotes the specified secondary cluster to assume full read/write capabilities
            and demotes the current primary cluster to a secondary (read-only) cluster, maintaining

            primary at the beginning of the process so the new primary continues operations for
            the Aurora global database without losing any data. Your database is unavailable for
            a short time while the primary and selected secondary clusters are assuming their
            new roles. For more information about switching over an Aurora global database, see

STANDARD mode will be used if the execution environment cannot be determined. The auto detection might query <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">EC2 Instance Metadata service</a>, which might introduce latency.

             Amazon Relational Database Service  
             <para>
             Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier
             to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient,
             resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common
             database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their
             applications and businesses unique.
             </para>
              
             <para>
             Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft
             SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean
             that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases
             work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your
             database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon
             RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity
             to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front
             investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

             <para>
             This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or
             command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous,
             which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback
             functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter
             descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance
             reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and
             we list following some related topics from the user guide.

            before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster.
            This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default
            database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined

            <para>
            For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas
            (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster

            <para>
            For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, after RDS terminates the primary DB instance, the internal
            monitoring system detects that the primary DB instance is unhealthy and promotes a
            readable standby (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance
            (the cluster writer). Failover times are typically less than 35 seconds.

            An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if one

            <para>
            To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover.
            Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean
            up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when
            the failover is complete.

             Amazon Relational Database Service  
             <para>
             Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier
             to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient,
             resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common
             database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their
             applications and businesses unique.
             </para>
              
             <para>
             Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft
             SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean
             that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases
             work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your
             database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon
             RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity
             to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front
             investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

             <para>
             This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or
             command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous,
             which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback
             functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter
             descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance
             reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and
             we list following some related topics from the user guide.

            <para>
            A blue/green deployment creates a staging environment that copies the production environment.
            In a blue/green deployment, the blue environment is the current production environment.
            The green environment is the staging environment. The staging environment stays in
            sync with the current production environment using logical replication.

            You can make changes to the databases in the green environment without affecting production
            workloads. For example, you can upgrade the major or minor DB engine version, change
            database parameters, or make schema changes in the staging environment. You can thoroughly
            test changes in the green environment. When ready, you can switch over the environments
            to promote the green environment to be the new production environment. The switchover
            typically takes under a minute.

            <para>
            For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora Replicas
            (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance (the cluster

            <para>
            For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, after RDS terminates the primary DB instance, the internal
            monitoring system detects that the primary DB instance is unhealthy and promotes a
            readable standby (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance
            (the cluster writer). Failover times are typically less than 35 seconds.

            An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if one

            To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a failover.
            Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address, make sure to clean
            up and re-establish any existing connections that use those endpoint addresses when
            the failover is complete.

            Switches over the specified secondary DB cluster to be the new primary DB cluster
            in the global database cluster. Switchover operations were previously called "managed

            <para>
            Aurora promotes the specified secondary cluster to assume full read/write capabilities
            and demotes the current primary cluster to a secondary (read-only) cluster, maintaining
            the orginal replication topology. All secondary clusters are synchronized with the
            primary at the beginning of the process so the new primary continues operations for
            the Aurora global database without losing any data. Your database is unavailable for
            a short time while the primary and selected secondary clusters are assuming their
            new roles. For more information about switching over an Aurora global database, see
